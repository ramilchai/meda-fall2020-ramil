    <h2 id="heading2">Welcome to English 302, Advanced Composition!</h2>


    <p class="font1"><b>Course Goals: </b>This course is designed to build on the general writing skills and techniques you have acquired in 101
     and other university courses, and to prepare you for completing advanced level writing, analysis, 
     and research tailored to your major discipline and possible future workplace. 
     Throughout the semester, you’ll learn to recognize the ways that knowledge is constructed in your discipline, 
     to adapt your writing to common purposes and audience needs, to conduct and synthesize research, 
     to use technology as part of your research and writing process, 
    and to produce college-level academic writing.
    </p>


    <p class="font1"><b>Program and Students as Scholars (SaS) Course Goals: </b>This course participates in the Students as Scholars (SaS) program, 
    a university-wide initiative that encourages undergraduate students to engage in scholarly research.  
    Across campus, students now have increased opportunities to work with faculty on original scholarship, research, 
    and creative activities, through their individual departments 
    and the OSCAR office <a href="http://oscar.gmu.edu">(http://oscar.gmu.edu)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="font1">At the end of the course, the Office of Institutional Assessment and the Composition Program will collect random samples of students’ 
    final research projects to assess the effectiveness of the Students as Scholars Program. 
    This assessment has no bearing on your grade in the course.
    </p>

    <p class="font1">Below are course goals and learning outcomes for the composition program and the SaS initiative.</p>
