Project 2: Portfolio Prep

Colors: I get the color idea from: https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/. It called "Minimal Yet Warm." I think it gives a cool and modern look. Actually I prefer white background but on a second thought, white is kind of boring. 
	Therefore, I go with Eggshell color, still give a white-clean look but not actually white.
Body Text: 	Taupe Gray #8E8D8A
Header Text:	Dark Vanilla #D8C3A5
Link Text:	Jelly Bean Red #E85A4F (Back-up lighter red #E98075)
Background:	Eggshell White #EAE7DC

Fortunately, I am currently located in San Francisco, the home of the largest tech companies in the world. I can't resist the urge of jumping in one of the fastest growing industries in the planet.
Teching myself web design isn't simple--it takes a lot of dedication and self-discipline. Given an abundant of online resources, i could learn the content and build my portfolio faster and more effiecient at my own speed.

Inspiration portfolios:
David Venturi
Data Scientist
Link:	http://davidventuri.com/portfolio
Pros: 	I have to say David Venturi inspires me in the way that we came from the same engineering background which gave us strong mathematical and logic advantages. 
	I love white background in the "main" section. It gives a clean look.
	Each section is seperated nicely. 
	I really like the big giant image in background as a "header" of each web page. It looks modern and beautiful.
Cons:	Each box that contains a link to a code is too close to each other. I've found that it could use a little more space in between.

Danny Jones
3D Designer
Link:	https://yasly.com/work/
Pros:	Nice and clean layout with excellent choice of white backgroud color which contracts with the artworks.
Cons:	I know very little about the artist in the home web page. I don't even get the name. It could be because the minimal art style. I perfer to have at least a name on it.

Robby Leonardi
Freelancer/Art and Animation Designer
Link:	http://www.rleonardi.com/
Pros:	This is an awesome website showcasing his talent in web and interactive design. 
	The combination of colors is phenomenal. I love his color choice.  
	The social network link bottons are nice. I might adopt this design.
Cons:	Every content is in a seperate link which has to be loaded to get an access.
	In his portfolio, it looks pretty messy in my opinion.
