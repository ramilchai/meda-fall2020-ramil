Introduction
	Hello Rockers! My name is Ramil. Playing electric guitar has become my passion recently. I just picked up an electric guitar and started practicing it a month ago.
I've always wanted to start playing the instrument since I was young but never had a chance to get it rolling. I always regrat it, but not any more! No more staring at a mirror soloing an air guitar.
No more pretending to be a rock star. I'm ready to ROCK now!!

1. GUITAR!
	Getting an electric guitar can be frustrating and time-consuming step for someone who knows nothing about it. Don't be lazy and just pick cheapest one online. Visit a guitar store, look around, and have it try out! In case you don't know what to do; don't hesitate to ask store assistants; they are all happy to help a newby.
 The price of an electric guitar can go from cheapy-cheap as $199 to luxiously expensive as $4000+.
Don't make a decision based on price alone. Good beginning guitar should be the one that makes you want to keep picking it up and practice with a reasonable price.

2. Amplifier
	Amp can be so expensive as well. Don't worry to much about it. You can always upgrade later in life as you progress. Pick one that can do many in one. 
For example, it can replicate many professional grade amp. Or, it has built-in paddles which could save you a lot of money from buying electric guitar effects.
Or, it can connect to headphones in case you live in an apartment that has a thin wall and easily-annoyed neighbor.

5. Guitar cable
	No need for profression grade here. I prefer one with at least 15-20 ft. long as it allows me to change position more freely.

6. Tuner
	This is most important thing in your guitar journey. It'll make your life easier I gurantee you!
