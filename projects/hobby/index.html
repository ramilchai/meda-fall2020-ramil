<!--Introduction (1 paragraph)-->
    <p>Hello Rockers! My name is Ramil. Playing electric guitar has become my passion recently. I just picked up an electric guitar and started practicing it a month ago. I've always wanted to start playing the instrument since I was young but never had a chance to get it rolling. I always regrat it, but not any more! No more staring at a mirror soloing an air guitar. No more pretending to be a rock star. I'm ready to ROCK now!</p>

<!--Things to prepare-->

    <h2>After you already know about benefits of learning an electric guitar, here are some necessary stuff you need to unleash your inner ROCK spirit!</h2>

        <h3>GUITAR!</h3>
            <p>Getting an electric guitar can be frustrating and time-consuming step for someone who knows nothing about it. Don't be lazy and just pick cheapest one online. Visit a guitar store, look around, and have it try out! In case you don't know what to do; don't hesitate to ask store assistants; they are all happy to help a newby.</p>

            <p>The price of an electric guitar can go from cheapy-cheap as $199 to luxiously expensive as $4000+. Don't make a decision based on price alone. Good beginning guitar should be the one that makes you want to keep picking it up and practice with a reasonable price.</p>
            
            <p>Here is what makes me never stop practicing!</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="Charvel Electric Guitar in natural color with black neck" height="600" width="450"/>
                <figcaption>
                    It's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Duplantier" target="_blank">Joe Duplantier</a>'s signature guitar. He is a vocalist and guitarist of metal band Gojira.   
                </figcaption>
            </figure> 

        <h3>Amplifier</h3>
            <p>Amp can be so expensive as well. Don't worry to much about it. You can always upgrade later in life as you progress. Pick one that can do many in one.</p> 
                
            <p>For example, it can replicate many professional grade amp. Or, it has built-in paddles which could save you a lot of money from buying electric guitar effects.
            Or, it can connect to headphones in case you live in an apartment that has a thin wall and easily-annoyed neighbor.</p>

            <p>Here is some idea.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/amp.jpg" alt="Positive Grid's Spark 40 Amplifier" height="450" width="600"/>
                <figcaption>
                    Positive Grid's Spark amp has more than 1000 built-in effects to choose from. I got this one on sale for $225. <a href="https://www.positivegrid.com/spark/?utm_source=shareasale&utm_medium=newsfeed&utm_campaign=affiliate&sscid=91k4_g1ch4" target="_blank">Check Out Positive Grid's Spark Amp Here!</a>  
                </figcaption>
            </figure> 

        <h3>Picks</h3>
            <p>Pick one that you feel comfortable holding it for a couple hours.</p>
            
            <p>Here is what I've been using.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    I pick up a pack of six from Guitar Center for $6. It has 1mm thickness.  
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

        <h3>Strap</h3>
            <p>Roughly around $10-30. Pick one that's comfortable and looks good on your guitar!</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/strap.jpg" alt="Ernie Ball's guitar strap" height="600" width="450"/>
                <figcaption>
                    I got this one for $15 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ernie-Ball-Guitar-Strap-P04150/dp/B00UJ9LH86/ref=sr_1_8?crid=COEUQ2HBNR7E&dchild=1&keywords=guitar%2Bstrap&qid=1600309790&sprefix=guitar%2Bs%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-8&th=1" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.

            </figure>
        
        <h3>Guitar Cable</h3>
            <p>There is no need for a profressional grade here. I prefer one with at least 15-20 ft. long. It's good to have a length to spare in case you want to move around the room.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/cable.jpeg" alt="Guitar Cable" height="600" width="450"/>

                    I got this one from Guitar Center for $20. Again, you may find cheaper options on Amazon.

            </figure> 
        
        <h3>Tuner</h3>
            <p>This is the cheapest, yet most important thing you need to begin your guitar journey. Believe me it'll make your life much easier.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/tuner.jpg" alt="Guitar Tuner" height="600" width="450"/>
